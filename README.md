# eeatz

eeatz provides restaurant management software to family-owned multi-restaurant chains. eeatz allows owners and managers to access their budgets and expenses across restaurants in a sleek and modern visualization (versus a traditional clunky Excel spreedsheet).

## Getting Started

You can access the live site [here](WEBSITE). Managers can create a user profile and link to their restaurant. Once logged in, users can review their total budget & expenses, add a budget or expense, and edit their budget & expense history.
